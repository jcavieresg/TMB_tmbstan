# Why not a thin plate spline for spatial models? A comparative study using Bayesian inference

This repository contains the codes to reproduce the experiments in the articie.
Folders:
- simulation: codes for the simulation study
- real_application: codes for the Gamma and Skew normal models using an approximated GRF and TPS as spatial random effect.

  
All the codes uses Template Model Builder (TMB) along with the library $\texttt{tmbstan}$.
